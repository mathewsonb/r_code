This is where we talk about things like **Bold Type** or _Italics_, and even code blocks:

```{r}
n <- 50

print(n)
```
And here we can experiment with the use of LaTeX, such as the symbolic equation
$$
\textit{The Limit Definition of the Derivative is}\hspace{0.25in}\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}{\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{(x+h)-x}}=f'(x)
$$
